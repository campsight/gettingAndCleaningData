# Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

This is my course project for *Getting and Cleaning Data* on Coursera (Johns Hopkins University).

The purpose of the project is to demonstrate our ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. We are graded by peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. We are required to submit: 
1. a tidy data set as described below, 
2. a link to a Github repository with our script for performing the analysis, and 
3. a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that we performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. We should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

The latter is the file you are reading now. There is only one script (`run_analysis.R`), and the operations it executes are described in the `CodeBook.md`

The end result is shown in the file `tidy_data.txt`.
